## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The only necessary library to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python is sklearn.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

In this project, I applied unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. This analysis can be used to direct marketing campaigns towards people that will have the highest expected rate of return. The data that you will use has been provided by our partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook in the repository that contains the analysis performed, following the CRISP-DM process. Markdown cells were used to pose and answer questions throughout the analysis.

The data used in this project is proprietary and was not allowed to be included in this GitHub repository.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

Certain features of the population were found to be overrepresented by the customer data. Detailed conclusions can be found in the last cell of the Jupyter Notebook.

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

The project was part of Udacity's Introduction to Machine Learning Nanodegree program. The datasets were provided by AZ Direct and Arvato Financial Solutions.
